Hi! I'm Minje (pronounced "Min-j√©" as in "jet"), a Ph.D candidate in my third year at the [University of Michigan School of Information](https://www.si.umich.edu/) where I am co-advised by professors [David Jurgens](http://jurgens.people.si.umich.edu/) and [Daniel Romero](http://www.dromero.org/).
I am broadly interested in computational social sciences, and my current research involves using natural language processing and other data-driven approaches to study information diffusion and communication in social networks such as SNS platforms and online communities.

Right before my Ph.D, I did my undergrad and masters in computer science at Korea University where I was advised by professor [Jaegul Choo](https://sites.google.com/site/jaegulchoo/). 
I have done past internships with awesome people at [Naver Clova AI](https://clova.ai/en/research/research-areas.html) and [Nokia Bell Labs Cambridge](https://social-dynamics.net/).

I enjoy sharing and discussing research ideas on CSS and NLP domains and am open to collaborative work. 
Feel free to contact me via email if you found my work interesting or would like to collaborate in the future!
