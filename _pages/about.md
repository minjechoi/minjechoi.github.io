Hi! I'm Minje (최민제) (pronounced "Min-je" as in "jet" or "jelly"), a Ph.D candidate in my fifth year at the [University of Michigan School of Information](https://www.si.umich.edu/) where I am co-advised by professors [David Jurgens](http://jurgens.people.si.umich.edu/) and [Daniel Romero](http://www.dromero.org/).
I am broadly interested in computational social sciences, and my current research involves using natural language processing and other data-driven approaches to study information diffusion and communication in social networks such as SNS platforms and online communities.

Right before my Ph.D, I did my undergrad and masters in computer science at Korea University where I was advised by professor [Jaegul Choo](https://sites.google.com/site/jaegulchoo/). 
I have done past internships with awesome people at [Naver Clova AI](https://clova.ai/en/research/research-areas.html), [Nokia Bell Labs Cambridge](https://social-dynamics.net/), [Visa Research](https://usa.visa.com/about-visa/visa-research.html) [Snap Research](https://research.snap.com/team/category/computational-social-science.html).

I enjoy sharing and discussing research ideas on CSS and NLP domains and am open to collaborative work. 
Feel free to contact me via email if you found my work interesting or would like to collaborate in the future!

Personal updates
======
- (12.16.22) I completed my second internship this year at [Snap Research](https://research.snap.com/team/category/computational-social-science.html)! I worked with with [Francesco Barbieri]([https://fvancesco.github.io/) to study how the Bitmoji avatars of Snapchat users relate to several properties of friendship and spread through friendship networks. I will be continuing this project as a part-time intern until early 2023.
- (08.19.22) I completed my first internship this year at [Visa Research](https://usa.visa.com/about-visa/visa-research.html)! Along with my mentor [Xin Dai](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=n82TkYwAAAAJ&hl=en), I tackled the problem of developing efficient Transformer architecture models by reducing computational overhead within layerwise computation.
- (07.15.22) Our latest work, ["Analyzing the Engagement of Social Relationships During Life Event Shocks in Social Media"](https://minjechoi.github.io/publications/2022-relationships-shocks), got accepted to ICWSM'23! This work will also be presented at this year's [IC2S2](https://iscss.org/ic2s2/conference/). Stay tuned for updates on preprints and code.
- (05.03.22) I co-organized the 1st [NLP@Michigan Day](https://cse.engin.umich.edu/stories/natural-language-processing-at-michigan-research-day) at the University of Michigan, where it was a great opportunity to get in touch with people working in various domains of NLP from several different departments.
- (04.17.22) I will be doing two internships in the following months! The first will be a return this summer to [Visa Research](https://usa.visa.com/about-visa/visa-research.html) in Palo Alto, CA, where I will be working on Transformer models. The next will be at [Snap Research](https://research.snap.com/team/category/computational-social-science.html) where I will be doing more stuff on computational social sciences. Excited about both projects!
- (05.14.21) I will be doing an oral presentation on my previous work ["Ten Social Dimensions of Conversations and Relationships"](https://minjechoi.github.io/publications/2020-WWW) at [IC2S2 '21](https://ic2s2-2021.ethz.ch/)! 
- (03.15.21) Our paper ["More than Meets the Tie: Examining the Role of Interpersonal Relationships in Social Networks"](https://minjechoi.github.io/publications/2021-relationships) has been accepted to [ICWSM '21](https://www.icwsm.org/2021/index.html)! 
- (03.04.21) I will be the Graduate Student Instructor for the MADS course SIADS 655 Applied Natural Language Processing, taught by my advisor Prof. David Jurgens.
- (02.26.21) I passed our department's field prelim milestone and now am officially a Ph.D candidate! You can view the final draft for my review on "Understanding Brand Reputation and Online Firestorms through Social Media" [here](http://minjechoi.github.io/files/misc/Choi_prelim_final.pdf)
- (02.04.21) I will be doing an internship this summer at [Visa Research](https://usa.visa.com/about-visa/visa-research.html)! Looking forward to doing interesting NLP research with Dr. Javid Ebrahimi and the rest of the team :)
