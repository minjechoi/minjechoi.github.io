excerpt: 'In our study on Twitter, we analyze how users change their behavior after adding social identity signals to their profiles, revealing they tend to tweet more in line with their identity and connect with users sharing similar identities. Additionally, we found that openly disclosing identity through tweets and profiles correlates with receiving fewer offensive replies.'

Abstract: Our social identities determine how we interact and engage with the world surrounding us. In online settings, individuals can make these identities explicit by including them in their public biography, possibly signaling a change to what is important to them and how they should be viewed. Here, we perform the first large-scale study on Twitter that examines behavioral changes following identity signal addition on Twitter profiles. Combining social networks with NLP and quasi-experimental analyses, we discover that after disclosing an identity on their profiles, users (1) generate more tweets containing language that aligns with their identity and (2) connect more to same-identity users. We also examine whether adding an identity signal increases the number of offensive replies and find that (3) the combined effect of disclosing identity via both tweets and profiles is associated with a reduced number of offensive replies from others.
